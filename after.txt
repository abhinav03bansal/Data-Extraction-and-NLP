Paragraph 9: Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say. An Siri. Siri listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched. Paragraph 10: Now do, Let’s talk issue. Paragraph 11: AIs automation jobs, replacing humans do. This means job loss concentration wealth selected people. This destabilization society social unrest. In addition social unrest, improves time. This means smarter, faster, cheaper implement repetitive things humans do, preparing fast food. It predicted improve 50 100 years super intelligent. This means smarter intelligent human earth. According experts Elon Musk, end human civilization. potentially start war humans, burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. At point, theory, stop thought obstacles prevent goal. This means unplug machine, effect replace human intelligence. Paragraph 12: But, happen 10 30 years? Paragraph 13: NO! The field Artificial Intelligence sophisticated human tasks humans do. Currently, smart empathetic humans strategically solve complex problems. solutions expensive tests standards implement. It takes time improve. For example, Boston Dynamics, world’s top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk. Fast forward 2019, robot walk jump objects, backflips more. In addition timing, takes time price technological solution drop point affordable. For example, desktop computer costs $1000 1999 significantly powerful laptop exact price. curve. Paragraph 14: But 10 30 years? Will make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. As proven earlier faster cheaper. As happens, companies technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. As demonstrated, repetition machine learning. The difference learn faster time progresses due amount data today. It learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills. However, repetitive routine tasks better, understand emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity. This distinct example- IBM Paragraph 15: IBM IBM Watson program create movie trailer. Fox approached IBM movie coming #Scifi horror. They asked IBM platform IBM Watson trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary, Paragraph 16: Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner. IBM Watson generate trailer movie Morgan. The result, movie trailer created machines – Google Paragraph 17: 2018 google demonstrated assistance calls simple stuff. The set appointment! What fascinating understand nuances conversation. The receptionist thought human calling her. That primitive version technology. Eventually, conversations human beings do, making sales jobs obsolete. – generated art Paragraph 18: In 2018, Paris art collective consisting students artificial intelligence generate portrait. It generated portrait painting studying set fifteen thousand art images wiki art. It estimated worth thousand ten thousand dollars. The painting sold auction thirty-five thousand US dollars. Paragraph 19: However, replace human intelligence. This society started hard questions questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, research lab purpose promote discover artificial intelligence benefits humanity. In addition this, factors affect long-term outcome replacing human intelligence. Like, degree humans over? Depending field, people Artificial Intelligence them? Or prefer human counterpart? While control long run, secure short-term future. Paragraph 20: Strategic creative thinking Paragraph 21: The ability box human. There thousands thousands slightly outcomes result distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes sophisticated manner achieve. As billionaire founder Alibaba, Jack Ma famously – “AI logic, human beings wisdom”. Paragraph 22: Conflict resolution negotiations Paragraph 23: With understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge, equipped deal conflicts robots be. Paragraph 24: recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces. Humans, lesser greater degrees, capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. With application intuition delicately worded elusive languages, methods, properly judge person feels. Paragraph 25: Interpretation Gray Areas Paragraph 26: Robots computers function presented quantifiable data. However, situation enters gray area, term refers morals, processes, definitions robots falter. Paragraph 27: Critical thinking Paragraph 28: Humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. While system analyze documents true false statements made text, judge written analyze implication words meaning content. Paragraph 29: Paragraph 1: “Machine intelligence invention humanity make” Paragraph 2: Nick Bostrom Paragraph 3: To put frankly, Artificial Intelligence eventually replace jobs. Workers variety industries, healthcare agriculture manufacturing, expect witness hiring disruptions result Artificial Intelligence. Paragraph 4: If history taught anything, disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas make fortune innovators, build groundwork business models, market entrants, job opportunities inevitably follow. It true robots today future eventually replace humans jobs, innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. But jobs humans end here. We, hand, required generate provide ways business models result changes. Paragraph 5: According 71% businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence people overcome critical challenging problems live lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants work equally fair, whopping 83% corporate leaders. These results demonstrate Artificial Intelligence steadily extending measures, yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives. Paragraph 6: Since advent Industry 4.0, businesses moving fast pace automation, type industry. In 2013, researchers oxford university study future work. They concluded jobs high risk automated machines. Machine learning responsible disruption. It powerful branch artificial intelligence. It machines learn data mimic things humans do. Paragraph 7: A research conducted employees Kaggle algorithm created images human eye diagnose eye disease diabetic retinopathy. Here, winning algorithm match diagnosis human ophthalmologists. Another study conducted algorithm created grade high school essays. Here too, winning algorithm match grade human teachers. Paragraph 8: Thus, safely conclude data, machines easily outperform human beings tasks these. A teacher read 10,000 essays 40-year career; ophthalmologist 50,000 eyes machine read million essays million eyes minutes. Paragraph 9: Thus, convenient conclude chance competing machines frequent, high volume tasks. Paragraph 10: Tasks machines don’t work Paragraph 11: But tasks human beings upper hand, is, tasks. Machines can’t handle things haven’t times before. The fundamental rule machine learning learns large volumes past data. But humans don’t; ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems haven’t before. Paragraph 12: Percy Spencer physicist working radar world war 2 noticed magnetron melting chocolate bar. Here, connect understanding electromagnetic radiation knowledge cooking order invent microwave oven. Now sort cross pollination times day. Thus, machines compete tackling situations. Paragraph 13: Now 92% talented professionals soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter hard skills successful managing workplace. Perhaps, kind tasks machines compete humans at. Paragraph 14: Also, creative tasks: copy marketing campaign grab customers’ attention stand crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps market working them. Since machines outperform humans tasks, humans creating campaigns strategies. Paragraph 15: Human contact essential care-giving educational-related work responsibilities, technology backseat. Health screenings customer service face-to-face communication advocate human contact, Artificial Intelligence playing supporting role. Paragraph 16: So, future work? The future state single job lies answer single question: extent job reducible tackling frequent high-volume tasks extent involve tackling situations? Paragraph 17: Today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers, coming years they’re conduct audits, they’re read boilerplate legal contracts. But we’re needing accountants lawyers? Wrong. We’re complex tax structuring, path breaking litigation. It tougher jobs machine learning shrink ranks. Paragraph 18: Amazon recruited 100,000 robots warehouses move goods products effectively, warehouse workforce expanded 80,000 people. Humans pick pack goods (Amazon 480,000,000 products “shelves”), robots move orders enormous warehouses, reducing “the amount walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient exhausted.” Furthermore, Amazon longer requires aisle space humans, robots enable Amazon pack shelves cars rush-hour traffic.” More inventory roof offers selection customers, higher density shelf space equals inventory roof. Paragraph 19: Kodak, undisputed giant photography industry, 90% share market 1976, 1984, employing 1,45,000 people. But year 2012, net worth negative $1 billion declare bankruptcy. Why? Because failed predict importance exponential trends technology. On hand, Instagram, digital photography company started 2012 13 employees sold Facebook $1 billion. This ironic Kodak pioneered digital photography invented digital camera thought mere product didn’t pay attention created problem. Paragraph 20: We live era artificial intelligence (AI), tremendous computing power, storage space, information access. We spinning wheel first, electricity second, computers industrial revolution exponential growth technology. Paragraph 21: Airbnb, giant start-up enabling homeowners rent homes couches travellers, example, “is creating Artificial Intelligence system empower designers product engineers literally ideas drawing board convert actual products instantly.” This significant breakthrough you’re designer, engineer, type technologist. Paragraph 22: Differences Automation brings table: Paragraph 23: There key automation bring macro level: Paragraph 24: Artificial Intelligence isn’t fad. Tractica, market research firm, published report 2016 predicted “annual global revenue artificial intelligence products services expand 643.7 million 2016 $36.8 billion 2025, 57-fold increase time span.” As result, industry’s fastest-growing segment size.” Paragraph 25: The reduction people result Artificial Intelligence related technologies, resulted job layoffs, fear. In India alone, job losses sector reportedly reached 1,000 year, owing integration advanced technologies artificial intelligence machine learning. Paragraph 26: Most companies Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant reduced employee base India recruiting less, engaging personnel United States investing heavily “centres innovation.” Artificial Intelligence data science, trending aspects require fewer people primarily located abroad, aren’t helping prospects local employees. Another factor computer industry continuously growing develop size million workers. Unfortunately, it’s drop bucket compared robots Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers. Paragraph 27: Large e-commerce sites operated armies people manned 200 robots produced GreyOrange, Indian company based Gurgaon. These indefatigable robots lift stack boxes 24 hours day, 30-minute break recharging, cut employees 80%. For efficiency, victory disaster job prospects. Paragraph 28: Internal re-skilling redeployment staff critical requirement hour. Artificial intelligence presented Indian policymakers epistemological, scientific, ethical issues. This requires abandon regular, linear, non-disruptive mental patterns. The tale artificial intelligence’s influence individuals occupations told time. It upskill ways stay current industry’s current trends demands. Paragraph 29: So, machines jobs? The answer resounding yes. However, job robots, equal number positions people do. Some human vocations artistic nature. Others necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans machines form symbiotic relationships, assisting best. In future, people machines collaborate work common goal business work for. Paragraph 1: Where disruptive technology taking us? Take leave it, disruptive technology creates jobs depleted jobs. You notice jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots, machines, technology creating machines replace them. Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Machine Learning (ML) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior. Data Analytics tools, Google Analytics , today free, and, correctly, organizations save millions, billions dollars sales marketing. Paragraph 2: Before I on, I it’s level set constitutes machines. In context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment, robots, programmed learn, humans. Occasionally call Artificial Intelligence (AI), times call machine learning, times call robotics. And yes, technically things. These bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day. They tough tasks considered difficult human being. But, broad discussion related future work, totally interrelated. Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside them. A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily them. But forward step & advancement technology, threat proliferating, threat replaced work front. Every passing day sealing jobs humans globe. Similarly, turn hand-drawn sketches (done humans) digital source code. Paragraph 3: Companies developing robotics expertise idea technological innovations they’ll Paragraph 4: Of course, it’s machines creatives working either. In example, Amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things increased warehouse workforce 80,000. Humans, Amazon’s case, picking packing goods robots move orders giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient tired.” Plus, robots “allow Amazon pack shelves cars rush-hour traffic longer aisle space humans. The greater density shelf space means inventory roof, means selection customers.” Paragraph 5: During decades (or sooner), notion work handled human virtual hinge predictability. As starting today, machines manage routine humans unpredictable – tasks require creativity, problem-solving, flexibility. In context, robotics means improve operations efficiency improve quality life workers. Paragraph 6: Although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation, true highly repetitive tasks—and mechanical ones—are ideal robots. Besides greater efficiency speed, automation leads lower risk accidents, greater control autonomy, all, fewer costs organizations. Paragraph 7: Although artificial intelligence machine learning make robots endowed superior intelligence, fact don’t ability learn experience respond unknowns. So things stand, processing speed automatic learning robot has, doesn’t beat factors innate human brain. Humans essential part process. Think delivering services client. Most customer challenges routine, humans play important role addressing issues, solving time appear, consolidating process system. Paragraph 8: While machines humans proximity, robots expensive, doesn’t apply types, based Robotic Process Automation (RPA), development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs. Paragraph 9: Moreover, domestic robots—be vacuum cleaner, lawn mower pool cleaner—are increasingly part daily lives. This level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control, security comfort. Paragraph 10: The division humans machines clear – I’m here, machine – boundary fuzzier. Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies, making lost limbs providing additional strength, stability, resilience, exoskeletons donned assembly line workers. Paragraph 11: We smartphones symbiotically, integrated directly bodies? Think smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain. Think sounds science fiction? Think again. The prototypes built. Paragraph 12: Soon, brain-computer interfaces seamless well, creating synergistic relationship cloud us. At point, question moot; question I answer. Sometimes answer stored neural circuitry, time connection neurons web. Our brain’s decision process influenced “educated” cultural context. These external factors influencing decision processes point situations, legitimately claim influence strong brains can’t held accountable choices made. The point I’m make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools – physical conceptual – taught use. My guess transformation subtle. Paragraph 13: Practically speaking, robots growing point world start creating smarter, robots impractical concern. None expected future, long shot. If you’ve ATM, waited PC boot catastrophic failure, game crash box reach checkpoint, understand world machines perfectly right. Before jobs, theirs’ flawlessly; then, depend humans mess lives. Paragraph 14: This isn’t win-or-lose situation. We’re wind partner smarter machines, partnership fostered augmentation technology. Machines play essential role augmentation and, successful technology, fall level perception. In end, revolution silent invisible. Paragraph 15: Paragraph 1: In future upcoming years humans machines work field work. In upcoming days machines human being. Machines [AI technology] work humans incapable doing. Machines partner co-operate humans. Paragraph 2: According professor university Washington, explained that, result AI, demand existing jobs jobs created unimaginable today. Human workers machines work flawlessly, complementing other. Machines learn carry easier tasks processes crunching data. They humans difficult. Machines create great job opportunities humans future. John Kelly ll, executive vice president IBM “Man Machines working beat make decision man machine independently.” Paragraph 3: In future, sectors country agriculture sector, industrial sector service sector utilize machines. So, work difficult. As now, agriculture purposes kinds machines called modern farming method. Some major technologies [machines] harvest automation, autonomous tractors, seeding, weeing drones.

Paragraph 23: Paragraph 1: Before discussion, let’s discuss basic working data analysis. Paragraph 2: Data analysis defined process cleaning, transforming, modeling data discover information business decision-making. Paragraph 3: Using data analysis, extract information data decisions based analyzed data. Paragraph 4: During pandemic COVID-19, businesses failed grow touched sky, example, transportation raw materials drastically low because: Paragraph 5: On hand, business/startups chance compete market early responses companies wanted tie head companies wanted investments from. Paragraph 6: The data analysis businesses ways as: Paragraph 7: Data analysis analytical techniques as: Paragraph 8: Using techniques, businesses analyze predict anything. Paragraph 9: These techniques, tools, models, businesses tackle horrendous situation COVID-19. Paragraph 1: The Covid- 19 pandemics forced factories shut down, flights canceled massive decrease global economy, significant decrease Green House Gases (GHG) developed developing countries. Paragraph 2: The SARS- CoV2 spotlight December 2019 impacted countries till then. Nearly 131 million peoples infected worldwide resulting deaths 2.9 Million World Health Organisation (WHO). Most countries dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus. These policies caused adverse effects worldwide. One important impacts Covid-19 Pandemic environment. Paragraph 3: There positive impacts environment due lockdown like, air pollution decreased dramatically, people asked stay houses due lockdowns. There sharp decline environmental noise. Environmental noise defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities noise emitted road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, industrial activities. It important challenges modern era noise pollution adverse effects humans harm animals too. The imposition lockdown quarantine nation’s governments caused people remain back homes. Because this, movement people place place reduced significantly personal public transport decreased. Due changes, environmental noise generated cities dropped substantially. Paragraph 4: Paragraph 5: Water Pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted back cities, covid-19 virus generated negative indirect effect environment. Paragraph 6: To begin with, developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic. In United States European nation-States, waste recycling plants suspended municipalities cities due concern virus spread recycling centers. This resulted increase single-use plastic bags re-usable bags leading restaurants, firms, corporations. For instance, Starbucks, leading coffee company month March 2020, announced short-lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups. Paragraph 7: Furthermore, people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores, shops, restaurants, food outlets closed, making online purchase food delivery high. This created consumption demand fossil fuels due transportation mobility goods individual. There enormous upsurge medical waste- products employed healthcare professionals single-use items disposed of. Some wastes include masks, personal protection kits, gloves. For instance, 200 tons medical waste generated peak pandemic breakout Wuhan, China. This 50 tones average waste generated outbreak Wuhan. Paragraph 8: Paragraph 9: These organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment environmental issues water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, harm local flora fauna. Paragraph 10: The demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non-woven fabrics. Polyester, Polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, common materials surgical mask density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq. meter. These materials resistant liquids plastic-based products high afterlife discarded. If treated properly discarding, end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. For example, recently environment Hong Kong started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes. Paragraph 11: Paragraph 12: With recycling plants hold, piles small mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day. This makes surrounding vulnerable creating high risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane (CH4), greenhouse gas, increasing risk global warming too. Not surroundings affected careless methods, local people affected. If excess methane accumulated Earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes, result increases Earth’s average temperature harmful future generations. Paragraph 13: Many protected endangered flora fauna facing greater risks due imposition lockdown. Many countries lockdown made people stay inside homes. The employees, NGOs, volunteers working protected areas National Parks, Marine Conservation Zones, wildlife sanctuaries made stay home making protected endangered flora fauna unattended. This led increase illegal activities wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, fishing activities due absence people. The prohibition eco-tourism led significant financial drop economy protected areas. Paragraph 14: Some nations China asked local authorities native government bodies increase amount disinfection routine, increase dosage chlorine wastewater treatment plant prevent spread COVID-19 virus. However, (2020), solid evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater drinking water. Despite fact excessive amounts chlorine water harmful problems issues people’s health bladder cancer damages cells. Paragraph 15: The COVID-19 reminder health planet linked health humans. Evidence proves virus zoonotic, meaning transmitted people animals. They accountable seventy-five percent emerging infectious diseases World. With Virus infecting millions people day globe, Various governments agencies’ top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes (especially clinical medical waste). Likewise, time, responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears. Paragraph 16: Paragraph 17: In Spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, History witnessed rise pollution “post-financial crisis”. A similar case observed 2008 financial crash – temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. After all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. To prevent future outbreaks, address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends Earth’s life. Paragraph 18: If live spacious outdoor area, desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space walk in, begin realize beauty nature. The point remain indoors, avoid close contact others. When leave home, walk desert run street, make wipe surfaces contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands. Paragraph 19: Paragraph 1: Even COVID-19 halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak countries, notably US, India, Brazil. It fact Data Analytics big guns artillery fight COVID-19 pandemic. It helped stages outbreak, detection outbreak, vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing, future hotspot detection. Some interesting applications discussed article. Paragraph 2: A lesser-known fact COVID-19 outbreak detected Toronto, Canada, 7,230 miles outbreak, days issued warning. It Big Data Analytics AI, specifically Deep Learnings (DL, subset Machine Learning) application Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province China. The specialty DL algorithms mimic brain cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data. This DL-backed software inputs, reports public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, etc. These flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases. Paragraph 3: The application Big Data Analytics Research Development drugs halt COVID-19. analyze protein structure virus, findings significant progress vaccine development. In preliminary studies, found mutate fast viruses HIV, means prophylactic vaccine proceed therapy. But evidence supporting fact find kind cure it, chance virus mutating, happened major mutations found UK, Brazil, South Africa. assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting set vaccines effective coronavirus. Paragraph 4: Another interesting application found selection candidates, i.e. test positive testing coronavirus case insufficient testing resources. This method exercised Greek borders called project EVA. Whenever traveler wanted Greece, fill form Passenger Locator Form (PLF) 24 hours prior arrival, information origin country, demographics, point, date entry, intended destination. allocated testing resources size set passengers tested. After test results, found positive, put quarantine. The results back program real-time learning. Paragraph 5: The question remains made allocations, It found that, statistically, origin country city significant factors screening. Ultimately, variety countries city pairs, predict testing resources allocated entry point passengers location technically called Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, chosen method solve problem algorithm called optimistic Gittins index. This algorithm identified average 1.85x asymptomatic, infected travelers random surveillance testing, 2-4x peak travel. After test results, found positive, put quarantine. Following collection significant data aforementioned process, period, policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location. This presented operation August 6th November 1st processing 38,500 PLFs day testing average 18.5% households entering country day. Paragraph 6: Above mentioned applications show tip iceberg developments watch include Image Recognition identify covid based x-ray images, Deep Learning predict 3-D protein structure COVID-19 on. Paragraph 1: “Data oil” important trendline 21st century. The reason advancements fields related data analysis. The field Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace, fields popular buzzwords days. Paragraph 2: Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress. This main reason misconception people. AI, ML, Stats, Data Mining, fields related analysis data mistook thing, words interchangeably convey thing. But true all! Paragraph 3: The similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “information”. Paragraph 4: In academics, learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining, academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored, case articles explain difference. Thus, primary confusion learners. Hence, article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions. Paragraph 5: The essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach achieve aims. Paragraph 6: The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities. Then satisfy aim, understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent? The answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror! Yes! Humans examples intelligent entities. Thus, 1900s, researchers began exploring thought process, reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior aim initial years research. After setting goal, studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks, sufficient fool interrogator. But test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence. Because intelligence related working human brain human brain, intelligence meaning! Paragraph 7: Thus, mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim. The field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process. The difference understand thought process mimic it, build it. The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain. So, basically, initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent. Paragraph 8: Concurrently, field computer science developing greater pace. With advances computer science, experiments theories easily tested validated. As programs applied solve real-life problems, found computers performed humans tasks complex humans. One examples chess-playing program. An program defeated world’s chess player Garry Kasparov. This incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program. This leads question, human intelligence ideal intelligence? Paragraph 9: As computers advanced, proved humans complex tasks. That definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems. So, nature agents, researchers began study nature intelligence itself. Then question test validate intelligence? The test intelligence solve cognitive problems. An agent intelligent solve complex problem. The problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers. Thus, researchers began studying ideal intelligence, selected agent validate experiments computer. So, computer problem-solving approach adopted. So, human-centered approach computer, problem-solving approach main aims AI. Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights. Paragraph 10: Both aims important collaboratively form main aim AI! Paragraph 11: In problem-solving approach, big challenge overcome order achieve aim. Consider solving math problem. There cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach. Let math problems solve. The problem familiar problem not. Paragraph 12: Consider problem. The problem familiar you, means solve kind problems solved similar problems past. So, question, mind solve problem? The answer is, solved similar problems past, learned past data, solve problems, haven’t problem past, solve similar problems. This form intelligence. Paragraph 13: Consider case problem solved kind problems past. Then solve problem, consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion. This kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. This kind intelligence. Paragraph 14: For build intelligent agents, kinds intelligence developed agent. But, reality reached point build agents learn past data find information. today reached point build agents own. That type intelligence. Paragraph 15: So, implement type intelligence Machine Learning! So, domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning. That reason ML called subset AI! So, main difference ML. Paragraph 16: Technically speaking, “It field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions, patterns explicitly programmed”. This statement elaboration. The essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data. Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. Consider humans recognize daily life objects. If animal, easily recognize “dog” “cat”. It trivial task wondered mind it? The answer Generalization! Paragraph 17: If picture dog, easily recognize picture dog, because, minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog. So, dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds. Paragraph 18: With generalization only, real “information”. So, give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own. Paragraph 19: This discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics deal data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Paragraph 20: Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics. It explain information possible, easily large data complex task otherwise. Paragraph 21: Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data. We inference tasks daily lives. Consider simple case cooking soup. After completing recipe, taste small sample, is, spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. Depending result sample, make inference soup soup whole, good bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. For example, case gather data time-consuming costly. In cases, applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty. That inferential statistics help. Paragraph 22: So, data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, data, statistics explain data. This aim resonate ML, statistics fields correctly interpret data! Paragraph 23: “Data”, raw form. Consider examples sensors industrial applications. These sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature, pressure, etc. The raw data generated sensors converted suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, solve problem! Paragraph 24: Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets, gather insights, Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery”. That why, Carly Fiorina, CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. This statement completely explains aim Data Mining! Paragraph 25: So, difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. But approaches fields, fulfilling aims fields. This beauty fields! Paragraph 1: Data Science gaining popularity exponentially past decade, enjoying products, recommendations, smoother life. Data science interdisciplinary subject includes statistics, math, IT, etc. Paragraph 2: Now Data Science, arrangement accessible place. It hectic hundreds resources analysis building models.

Forecast future technologies matter accurate – eventually influence action. Paragraph 1: In era, busy life. No spares time someone. robots tackle life loneliness? We time stand stare. This loneliness. Loneliness due fast-moving life hurry worry. In 21st century, spending time earning money. They day-by-day transforming money-earning machines. Due perception, losing relations can’t give time families. They busy earning livelihood. They satisfies more. Everyone race earning sends children make settled order maintain status. But faces consequences kind lifestyle age. People don’t spend time children children childhood yearn company children age. They feel lonely talk with. They attached people, places, belongings, memorable events past, understand life continue earlier, easily result feelings loneliness social isolation. As older, attended order meet daily needs. Robots serve purpose aid mechanical care. They emotionless, feeling fewer entities. Robots aren’t creative. They work pre-programmed system till software created transfer human feelings robots. This major loophole robots tackle late-life loneliness. They undoubtedly serve masters masters can’t share feelings incapable understand react them. They can’t change activity occasion. They provide emotional satisfaction emotional gratification, loneliness can’t tackled. A master attached robot attachment due service. They can’t share thoughts them. In era, rendered lonely late- life feel companion talk. We feel listen us, react, advise tackle day-to-day life problems. But can’t find one. We have, undoubtedly, achieved great progress terms technology fill void heart person struggling late-life loneliness advancements. We kind mental trance experience fame, progress, wealth, etc. gain consciousness, find lonely world. Relations life actual wealth person’s life. We enjoy bond robot. It follow commands, care can’t react emotions. It can’t console us. When man lives loneliness long time, eats conscience transforms machine. Robots friends, crack jokes, weep tears, establish emotional connection us. They can’t understand feelings. Many people depression. Depression occurrence depressive symptoms prominent condition older people, significant impact well-being quality life. They remain sick loneliness directly impacts longevity. Lonely people longer needed world die. It impacts mental, psychological, social, physical health. Robots prove useless matters. They provide motivation, software can’t, themselves, react situation. They don’t anger, happiness, sadness. They don’t bring food master hungry commanded so. They can’t offer glass water themselves. A man living relations fellow feeling longer remains human being. He machine as, due loneliness, mentally ill condition trauma longer enjoys nature’s blessings, happy sad loses ability react can’t act. It’s dangerous situation. We face plethora challenges assisted living facilities addressed emotional needs, neglected, forcing withdrawal social activities. Relations life, interaction fellow beings, sharing joy happiness, fellow feeling make man mere ‘being’ ‘social being’ finally human being. Paragraph 1: Care Robots, suggests, robots hospitality purposes fetching water, cracking jokes keeping patient good harmony, etc. Paragraph 2: The senior care industry forefront period. The reason being, Nuclear families busy schedule day parents nuclear family old, children care of. Instead, nursing homes trend. Parents mental illness put rehab. Paragraph 3: As observed decades robots taking care activities dominating fields automobile industry. So, Machines humankind achieving remarkable success fields. Paragraph 4: Do senior citizens love machines ?, You watch TV love play video games smartphone. So, If give human-like structure ability smartphone make people happy monstrous feat. Paragraph 1: Management acts guide group people working organization coordinating efforts, attainment common objective.Management challenges future digitalization healthcare services Paragraph 2: In current day age, wave digitization world. All emerging technologies Artificial Intelligence helping people live easier life. The service sector benefited lot digitization. It boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi, year 2015, launched campaign ‘Digital India.’ Among industries service sector, digitization massive impact operation healthcare diagnostic industry. It helped development industry enhances life millions people. The condition India terms healthcare grim. Patients attention neglected unable avail proper treatment diagnosis. However, coming digitization, hoped industry also. Paragraph 3: According Dr. Keshab Panda, CEO & MD, L&T Technology Services, Paragraph 4: This model healthcare doctors hospitals paid based patient health outcomes. The coming digital tools segment healthcare considered starting tool. Dr. Panda implementation advanced digital technologies patient-care domains like- mobile health apps, telehealth, wearables, remote monitoring enhancing accessibility, boost efficiency augment effectiveness treatment preventive care. Paragraph 5: The healthcare industry past decades changed drastically. With coming emerging technologies, surgical procedures medical devices made available. Paragraph 6: While talking connectivity healthcare, Dr. Panda digitization taking industry, matter time internet smartphones, digital healthcare everywhere. The internet helped doctors connect patients another. This helped enhancing doctor-patient engagement increasing interaction time. Paragraph 7: Big data aggregates information business formats social media, eCommerce, online transactions, financial transactions, identifies patterns trends future use. Paragraph 8: Although ransomware, data breaches, cybersecurity concerns healthcare industry, 2020 Covid-19 pandemic revealed vulnerable sensitive patient health information is. Paragraph 9: The recent growth digital health initiatives- telehealth doctor visits — major contributor severe increase breached patient records. As healthcare functions continue move online year, it’s extremely important ensure processes protected threats. Paragraph 10: Medical practices citing patient collections top revenue cycle management struggle patients responsible larger portion medical bills. In order encourage patients submit payments timely manner, providers adhere patient payment preferences. Paragraph 11: To meet patient expectations improve user experience, ensure billing statements patient-friendly. You offer paperless statements variety payment options (e.g. credit card, etc.) online patient portal utilize latest payment technologies, mobile text-to-pay. New features text email reminders effectively communicate patients encourage pay financial obligations. Paragraph 12: The medical insurance landscape experienced significant recent years. As patients responsible larger portion healthcare bill, naturally demand services providers. Paragraph 13: Healthcare organizations face tougher competition attracting retaining patients demand experience matches level customer service expect consumer brands. Paragraph 14: They demand streamlined patient experience “self-service” resolve questions, issues, concerns (e.g., downloading immunization record, booking appointment, paying bills, checking account/insurance status) whenever, wherever, convenient them. Paragraph 1: One thought mind…What lived dander hanging heads?And danger is. For 70 years world faced real threat nuclear war.Nuclear war real growing threat. The United States Russia left critical agreements treaties, actively planning add types weapons arsenals.Meanwhile, US nuclear policy remains rooted Cold War, increasing risk nuclear weapons again.It doesn’t way. With policy commitment diplomacy, United States leader reducing nuclear threat them. But question arises activities prevention nuclear holocaust?And : Paragraph 1: Paragraph 2: Imagine speak comprehend you. You captivity, place breathe. You finally selected place, happy moment you. You finally freedom sadly free, prodded rods fed toxic substances will. The thing scream vain. Your voice heard lost noise scientific advancement. You writhe pain substances effect body, pain slowly creeps body slowly succumb it, wake again. Paragraph 3: Since time Aristotle, animals subjected inhumane experiments sake knowledge. These experiments unethical advancement science. Animal testing important part experimenting living organisms ensure product safe humans consume. The lab animals generally subjected high levels toxicity isolation due suffer lot stress discomfort. Animal testing large number drawbacks: Paragraph 4: All things make question ourselves. Is worth it? Is stop cruelty hampering growth? Paragraph 5: With advancement science, made don’t animals again. Paragraph 6: These bio-printed models researchers conduct experiments animals it. A French company working bio-printed liver model test liver toxicity animals all. This breakthrough field bio-technology bring animal experimentation large percentage. Paragraph 7: These alternatives bringing animal experimentation large extent. If science progress harming animals putting excruciating pain. We protect animals living world them. Paragraph 1: Introduction Paragraph 2: The definition consciousness controversial centuries, title ‘most familiar mysterious aspects lives’. An idea concept awareness beings surroundings, themselves, perception. The reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness isn’t observable, unlike brain matter studied scientifically. physical clarification awareness general sense incomplete: doesn’t include feels subject, subject. There likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness. As suggested incident Eastern Shamir traditions, consciousness universal primal. Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years, research hasn’t answer questions relating nature emotions experiences. Paragraph 3: History Paragraph 4: Beginning late nineteenth century, time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind, typically equated consciousness. As result, analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain. Paragraph 5: The Ancient Mayans propose sorted feeling degree consciousness, purpose, worldly association mankind. Since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature interior stimuli, Mayans trusted essential type existence, equipped evolution. The Incas, however, thought consciousness movement mindfulness worry too. Paragraph 6: John Locke, early philosopher, consciousness, individuality, freelanced substances. He detected reason consciousness stuck specific body mind, consciousness transferred body mind one. Karl Marx, early thinker, denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one’s settings. William James, American psychologist, differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous shifts. Paragraph 7: While main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors primary half twentieth century, analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s. Paragraph 8: In Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, believed levels awareness- preconscious, conscious, unconscious responsible one’s behavior thinking. He believed mid divided parts- id, ego, superego. The Id present birth, instinctual, operates pleasure principle. The ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. Finally, superego internalization society’s moral standards responsible guilt. Now, Id regarded unconscious, ego superego conscious preconscious. Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches, however, didn’t conduct scientific experiments work heavily scrutinized, leaving questions unanswered. Paragraph 9: Sigmund Freud’s theory differed psychologists theories understandable easily conveyed people. Sigmund Freud’s work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth, character, memory, sexuality, therapy. However, theories subject considerable criticism life. Whilst John Locke William James practical approach mystery conducting experiments, Sigmund Freud didn’t provide evidence support claims. Paragraph 10: Brain Paragraph 11: Today, essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally. Issues interest include phenomena perception, blindsight, brainwaves sleep, altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs. Paragraph 12: A greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters. However, confirm criticalness verbal reports, researchers contrast action brain —that is, search neural connections consciousness. Paragraph 13: Hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain, pattern global brain activity, greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness. A brain imaging strategies, example, EEG MRI scans, utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations. Paragraph 14: A investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain isn’t adequate create consciousness: workable subjects report absence awareness event, areas, example, primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus. Higher brain areas viewed encouraging, prefrontal cortex, involved range high order functions. Paragraph 15: One mainstream theory implicates examples brain waves creating conditions consciousness. Analysts record mind waves, drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum, electroencephalograph (EEG) placing electrodes scalp. The types brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, delta) correspond mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, deeply asleep) Paragraph 16: Memory Paragraph 17: Episodic memory regarded form conscious memory. This capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past. The hippocampus located brain’s temporal lobe responsible type memory. Paragraph 18: Consciousness plays part important memory distinctions. One distinction implicit explicit characteristics; explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious of. Paragraph 19: Furthermore, empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness. Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks. Paragraph 20: The current ways testing information lacking essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, scope. Examples methods PET, fMRI, EEG, implanted electrodes, etc. Paragraph 21: PET fMRI temporal resolution problems, EEG well-known localizability difficulties, implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons; is, restricted scope. Hence, huge numbers speculations, testable fundamental level, difficult test now. Paragraph 22: Mental illness Paragraph 23: Consciousness influence objects us, encourages settle choices communicate them. Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems, example, agnosia (a failure decipher visual data), Alzheimer’s disease, autism. However, don’t comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object. Paragraph 24: Several disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, brain death. Paragraph 25: Locked-in syndrome, called pseudo coma, condition patient aware can’t move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body vertical eye developments squinting. The individual conscious speak eye movements. Paragraph 26: In minimally conscious state, patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness. Patients give restricted, reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance. This straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, purposeful conduct. Paragraph 27: In persistent vegetative state, patient sleep-wake cycles, lacks awareness, communicate, displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior. The term refers organic body grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse Paragraph 28: Like coma, chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury, central brainstem sores. Usually, metabolism grey matter decreases 50-70% normal range. The patient lies eyes shut doesn’t environmental factors. Paragraph 29: Brain death irreversible end brain activity, function (including involuntary activity sustain life). The main total necrosis cerebral neurons loss brain oxygenation. After brain death patient lacks sense awareness; sleep-wake cycles behavior, typically dead deep sleep state. Paragraph 30: Future predictions conclusion Paragraph 31: As history scholar’s endeavors study consciousness empirically, nature defined scientific methods. In past, psychologists Descartes dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics. In battle realists illusionists, taking sides fundamentally impossible topic doesn’t concrete evidence. Paragraph 32: As observe neural examinations brain detect consciousness, sensory sector brain aware event clear signs reaction stimulus. Similarly, consciousness plays major role memory, lack facilities research fully. In future, possibility access facilities, however, find neural connections ties mental illness well. Not people making aware perspective things, give chance recognizing signs mental illness issues beforehand. Paragraph 33: As seems, researchers continue study unknown part mind fund recover global pandemic, answer psychology’s difficult questions. Paragraph 1: Nature blessed humanity earth, rounded globe essential necessity lies hand human. Though 21st-century building Space shuttle exploring space obvious activity human raise, inclusion Start-ups Space dreamed reaching space coming true. We agree fact Growth industrialization generated humungous carbon footprint colonize outer space create much-needed area survival. Paragraph 2: With time human race visualized undergone transformations, transformations starters effective major role existence age. Be natural transformation shifting tectonic plates manmade Dumping water damaging water bodies, affected usual life humans creating space humans humans eyeing for. Paragraph 3: All idea Colonizing outer space emerged NASA launch space shuttle heavy payload late 1990s idea didn’t stir brain time apple eyes articles astronauts writeup limelight idea progression, space exploration normal, companies petrified number investments kinds projects for. But things change entry PayPal’s owner Elon Musk, 2002 laid stones Space X, NASA providing launchpad exploration. Paragraph 4: Being space travel legitimate bottlenecks knowing nature outer space boost idea colonizing, realize optimum. But main target company put forward themself planet back earth safely, earlier projects due high fund subdued priority rocket technology. Thus, unimaginable quest search space far-fetched though. Paragraph 5: Now 2020 find place colonizing space, kind emergence technologies led escalation spreading roots human existence, plan reaching outer space plays key role idea too. Proper Planning, Analysing, Organising, Executing required projects successful deeper I mention Space X, According wud successful sending Rockets 2022 colonize 2050, For achieving vision planned total 36 times pre-launch rocket launching 2020. Not star link satellites provide basic network connectivity colonized world, planned extent targeted profit $ 22 billion yearly 2025. Already manned rocket successfully Elon musk plan create infrastructure Mars cost regular air flight ticket lead chances colonizing planet. With setting commercial flight started red planet wud stepping stone colonizing outer space. Paragraph 6: But fundamental change people undergo living planet change gravity live support technical issues arise suit find similar place earth change humans adjust. Aspects Ultraviolet rays play immense role survival, rate technology expanding challenging boundaries days left find solutions aspects idea colonizing monetary terms projected building colony space cost $10 Trillian countries GDP. Placing amount funding highly anticipated projects tough. Elon addressed questions open Door believes cost find route colonize space costs justifiable space exploration reach heights. Paragraph 7: Also, world water percentage land comparison water less. Whereas population increasing speed level excitement order search things obsession innovative things finish. Because end, satisfy achieved, things crave achieve that. Paragraph 8: In order achieve planning crucial stage. As searched 9 planets didn’t shortlisted outcomes. But 3-decade theory ELON MUSK, possible. Paragraph 9: As important thing survive atmospheric environment, suitable not, order make suitable steps maintain suitable level oxygen. The missions focusing about. Finding source water, 2nd crucial thing needed survive. Paragraph 10: Apart excitement things, threats uncertainties bound happen kind mammal occur construction that. So security protection uncertainties replicated. Paragraph 11: After basic things, factors natural habitats there, plants grown not. If yes, types plants survive there. Paragraph 12: The environment animals safe not. Because balance nature types animals, natural habitat, insects small things ignorable plays important role maintaining environmental balance. For e.g. – Ants leading predators insects, helping pest populations low. Ants move approximately amount soil earthworms, loosening soil process increasing air water movement ground. They ecosystem clean dead insect carcasses aid destruction decomposition plant animal matter. So, small thing contributes way. Paragraph 13: Another matter concern level artificial intelligence machine learning required maintain kind requirement. Because current scenario, energy run vehicle robotics. So, availability energy source energy needed. Paragraph 14: And this, heat sun equally important order maintain level. Because artificial air survive long. So, order remain healthy calculation done. When thinking disease, heard news concern antibiotics (such penicillin) – fight infections – eventually stop working. Global health organisations reduce antibiotics, conditions aren’t serious. This overuse recent years means they’re effective. Paragraph 15: But survive antibiotics. Because ways dealing diseases caused bacteria isolation treated penicillin. Paragraph 16: It sound set firmly realm fantasy, experts private industry governments world understand feasible establish lunar base. Some scientists humans survive comfortably moon. In ways, minimal gravity moon conducive life microgravity astronauts experience International Space Station. Paragraph 17: Although hasn’t formally tested, experts hypothesize small amount gravitational force put astronaut’s body moon stem adverse effects bone-density muscle loss space flyers experience living microgravity International Space Station. Paragraph 18: By moon’s indigenous material, space agencies save money cost flying pricey missions moon’s surface. Once moon, stage costly missions aimed delivering oxygen resources Earth, experts material manufacture gasses needed sustain life satellite. Paragraph 19: On earth, protected radioactive solar winds cosmic rays magnet field magnetosphere. But space, can’t rely type protection, order make protection, lot upgraded technology achieve. Paragraph 20: Although till approximate project $10 trillion. But aim make fare equivalent normal air fare. Paragraph 21: As comfortable resources, securities uncertainties, risk analysis, probability survival human factors consideration, development won’t time. Paragraph 22: Because construct building 8-9 months. Which totally acceptable. Paragraph 23: But main concern density land, i.e. land capacity bear weight not. And type land adaptable cultivation nor. Although land converted types cultivation upgraded technology. Paragraph 24: In order transport equipments regular basis, large amount fuel Is required, factors Built propellor depo rocket landing building infrastructure city create forward idea Colonizing outer space. Paragraph 1: We’ve year. Like insatiable glutton, law averages home roost. We should’ve hint 1st January, 66 people lost lives Jakarta floods. What highlights reel disaster movie franchise – volcanic eruption The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires Australia, earthquakes Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, China. And speaking China. Paragraph 2: 2020 brought home fragile mortality human race sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past grim 1 million marks, choice question place universe – all-conquering masters domain, mere tourists ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is human race ubiquitous three-part literary arc defines story, life, civilization – ascent, apex, descent? Maybe Michael Jackson unveiled moonwalk 1983, Barack Obama stepped White House President United States 2008, MS Dhoni lifted Cricket World Cup 2011, peaked, species, steady unraveling. Paragraph 3: 500 years long time. For context, world population 1500 AD mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion unprecedented history, tip iceberg. Though fertility rates dropping people foregoing chance babies, crossed threshold – population projections year 2050 9.8 billion, 2100 whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere there, Malthus cackling grave. The year 2500 suddenly long off, conversation ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin Atomic Scientists optimistic – famed Doomsday Clock maintain closest ‘midnight’ (our proximity global catastrophe), inception 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check. Paragraph 4: And yet, hope floats, reasons. Mankind back wall now, shoots potential make 2500 AD – advent basket disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), private sector focus space exploration terraforming, good fashioned human resilience. While factors doubt critical human survival, pin hopes – long-demonstrated history surviving nature, universe, self-destructive tendency, throws way. Paragraph 5: The Next Superman? Paragraph 6: In 13th century, Italian town Pisa, enterprising tinkerer developed eyeglasses, local friar weakening eyesight2. All sudden, existed external device amplify senses, tool gave advantage survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give gift auditory perception back world muffled voices unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely augmented reality tool measure length objects front us. Paragraph 7: But real science starts imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, virtual reality tools ubiquitous decades. But that? Science answer, it’s thrilling scary. Artificial intelligence stuff fable, filler questions left unanswered. But AI, combined bio-enhancement genetic engineering, lead evolution calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau smarter, faster, agile, equipped adapt promises world VUCA imaginations. What human like? Paragraph 8: They small chip embedded brain utilizes artificial intelligence enhanced sensory perception. What mean? It means better, focuses attention longer, hears hear, communicate reaction rest body. Through chemical blood, chip demand response body. Bio-augmentation limbs organs, internal external, person longer determined birth, simply bought. All sudden, average Joe run faster Usain Bolt, swim Michael Phelps, and…fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering missing link. Already feverish conversations dystopian future featuring designer babies digital divide simply overcome inbuilt one’s DNA. The breakthrough CRISPR-Cas9 key unlock mysteries DNA manipulation. So there’s food left? Our body adjust appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity air specialized pores skin. The human 2500 AD recognize today. That shot. Paragraph 9: Galactic Dominance Paragraph 10: SpaceX, led mercurial leader Elon Musk, leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme based simple premise – earth’s closest planet terms distance terrestrial conditions, Mars bet colonization. Musk invested billions dollars Mars Space Programme remains fervent believer concept. And tech visionaries, Musk alone. Jeff Bezos, richest man world, owns Blue Origin, simply aims make spaceflight cheaper incremental technological growth. Bezos, online retailer books turned ever-expanding behemoth, man thinks small. With business leaders finding spaceflight planetary colonization tantalizing prospect, inevitably concerted push developing actual colony planet. And pull-factor development starts hitting diminishing returns, inevitable push factor global warming increase eruption pandemics begin toll. It feasible option people find alternate home, Mars, Saturn’s moons. Paragraph 11: A human colony Mars sounds concept straight science fiction, permanent station Antarctica decades ago. Mount Everest unapproachable summit ahead planted flag peak. Today, hundreds people year attempt climb. As spaceflight reasonable, urge explore supersedes inertia investment, closer chance survival – leaving planet earth finding home, forgiving follies. Paragraph 12: The Human Spirit Paragraph 13: The introduction article includes illustrative list disasters misfortunes struck global community year. And yet, survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt world masks social distancing, world on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve survived, human race, intrepid exploration world, pushes onward upward. Technological visionaries envision future rest see, invest money vision. Gradually, unthinkable suddenly real – moon landing that. Google launched Google Glass augmented reality wearable technology, suddenly foresee future smart eyewear. While product didn’t catch on, doesn’t companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation fast-developing industry, CRISPR-Cas9, “genetic scissors” held back regulatory bottlenecks. How long prospect fiddling gene code luxury necessity? The human spirit, tendency survive thrive costs, eventually win. Paragraph 14: The human race survive 2500, doubt. The real question is, person exists 2500, bionic chips bio-enhanced body structure modified genetic code, called Homo sapien? Or Homo nouveau forward? Paragraph 15: Paragraph 1: Mr. Sakamoto bonsai artist, lives downtown Kyoto, Japan. Bonsai Japanese art form cultivation small trees small medium container. He field business ten years loves daily basis. People cities Japan, buy artwork. But, early stage business, regular Bosai artist. His popularity increased stories tells art selling. His customer immediately loved buying A Bonsai art. He loved sell customer artwork story related product resurrects presence art customers. Soon business thrived nowadays busy. After digital revolution, sales increased, happy. He satisfied. Something eating mind day day. He understand what’s reason remorse. Paragraph 2: A chatbot awesome invention digital revolution. It real-life embodiment Customer Engagement. Every business feature- understatement. Because Customer engagement base business. The chatbot exact thing digitally. It helps customers answer queries product business offer fully automated vibrant customizations. Paragraph 3: Mr. Sakamoto running business fifteen years now. And happy past couple years. The rationale happiness chatbot. Though website app sell Bonsai art, engage customers wanted to. He trained employees apprentices, providing service does. He unsatisfied chatbot relives sadness. He affordable prices time. Paragraph 4: Let’s understand Mr. Sakamoto’s “Mondai Nai”- perspective chatbot answer problems. Paragraph 5: This fundamental root Mr. Sakamoto implement chatbot place. His stories embedded art. The product sells story it. His stories told customers sharing chatbot building trust them. We agree statement trust impactful aspect, aspects, relation customer business-owner, business small, medium, large. Paragraph 6: Millennials, word introduced 1990. The generation stuck Gen-x Gen-y. A generation people accustomed digitization culture. They targeted audience era. What approachable generation chatbot? It’s easy, time consuming use. Mr. Sakamoto Gen-x persons business millennial easily. Paragraph 7: Mr. Sakamoto employees apprentices. He trained needs. But limit. They can’t deliver exact things does. Neither chatbot exactly, accurately follow instructions. Not chatbot solve queries customer way, give recommendation product too. Is attribute care that? Absolutely no! Paragraph 8: The expensive thing businessman return customer empty hand unavailability. A chatbot perfect solve it. For Mr. Sakamoto’s customized chatbot present customers availability, It giving response customer time zone, world. Mr. Sakamoto wouldn’t happier feature. Paragraph 9: In era globalization, more, helpful chatbot? It customized language. It accessed human residing part world. And end day, foreigner happy buy felicitation “Arigato” language, moment feels warm happy. Paragraph 10: Handling lot customers hard. He assigned employees, rate growing fast. So, competition market, Mr. Sakamoto chatbot. Now automated customized application handling greater number customers employees do. His business growing exponentially. Paragraph 11: Now, found Mr. Sakamoto happy business growing competitive industry then, question mind business chatbot? Paragraph 1: Have wondered what’s common Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho? I lame question, ardent football followers. At instinct, answer regarded top managers football universe. #UCLwinners. But closer look, managers, weren’t great careers football players. Any naïve observer build fallacy causation correlation don’t great career football player great football manager. But restricted football? Mike Brearley, greatest captains history cricket author book art captaincy, wasn’t prolific batsman time. Our President, A P J Abdul Kalam didn’t political background, appointed president country finest presidents country had. So, stated confidence great leaders expert respective fields?Let’s understand leadership role, types leaders, explore perspectives arrive conclusion. Paragraph 2: Let’s start understanding leader. A leader position designation. It’s virtue employed correctly. From janitor CEO, student researcher, content writer philosopher leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) So, virtues leader? One famous personality trait theories, Big 5 personality trait theory linked closely leadership. As researches, personality traits extraversion, openness, conscientiousness leaders traits. Not humble empathetic considered adjectives frequently leaders. But technical expertise related leader. #NOTSOTECHNICAL Paragraph 3: As stated Colin Powell Leadership art accomplishing science management possible. #It’sART If leadership art leaders artists leaders viewed directors films organizing, arranging, managing, directing scenes. Another analogy orchestra conductor baton/stick set rhythm band. So, conductor great violinist? No. When corporate sector leader expert technology technology functions he/she utilize way. They allocate task building technology technical experts. And leaders identify person job? Or leaders qualities person? #Experience. Every great leader started frontline workers bottom pyramid hierarchical structure. Even technical expertise respective fields, visionary outlook, management skills, experience gathered helped achieving targets. Leaders assistance subject matter experts guide situations technical difficulties. As great man, situational trait theory leadership, leadership innate person. Leadership conditioned brought person rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment vision. Everyone read map, path choose isn’t taught. Leaders give direction vision company drive closer target company achieve. Leadership theories don’t focus technical knowledge leaders, people skills, approach problem, guide hire job done, evident managerial skills required Robert Katz. Paragraph 4: Though argued technical experts great leaders areas, leaders generally middle management level. As leadership styles, servant leader achieve goal team. These leaders management objective laid front drive team closer achieving target people-first mindset, collaborative approach solving problem. These people leaders needed execution level project close employees bottom-most level. Since managers top pyramid don’t time invest people appoint people behalf job done. Paragraph 5: Consider firm. So points mentioned above, leader manager shouldn’t code? Depends. If person line manager code team achieving target producing garbage project’s KPIs. The project manager, operations manager, (#MBA) background, line code written algorithms logic code validate code client’s perspective. The CEO, background run firm syntax code. Paragraph 6: But today’s competitive world leaders can’t dimensional. They expertise multiple areas top. Mike Brearley chance play T20 match, won’t picked aside, age, great batting statistics(#Thegamehaschanged). His leadership skills won’t squad. But great leader selected coach top 15 captains world today. As discussed film directors, job isn’t teach cameramen set operate (lens settings, etc) camera. Their job guide cameramen angle held coordinate lights crew perfect shot captured. So leader technical expert field, approach mindset, understands system process, hire talent job work guiding talent, vision. Paragraph 7: So, answer question, paragraph, no. Depending position hierarchy (yes front-line manager CXO) type leader are, level technical expertise needed varies. Though stated earlier Robert Katz, CXO’s amount technical expertise, CXO technology functions applications. What processes build technology. He done, (#itsnothowitswhat). Otherwise, company sitting gold mine If leader isn’t aware isn’t learned it, company succeed resources disposal. Leaders command respect don’t demand that’s give front-line employees, seek timely advice technical experts, put resources uses. Otherwise, surrounded technical experts dilberts. (#dilbert) Paragraph 1: The word “leadership” bring mind variety images. For example, A political leader, pursuing passionate, personal An executive, developing his/her company’s strategy beat competition. Leaders things. They set direction, build inspiring vision, create new. Leadership mapping “win” team organization; dynamic, exciting, inspiring. Paragraph 2: In point view good leader technical expertise task organization it’s required lot skills, knowledge, consistent, enthusiastic, patience, motivating, inspiring, industrious, critical thinking basis field doing. A leader ability motivate others, effective oral written communication, critical thinking skills working team delegating task. Good leaders abilities wanted create future leader. They large volume information essential elements define core problem solve. They organize team solve problems communicate group, established trust group trust team accomplish work alone. Though skills it’s sufficient make great leader excel utilize abilities practice lot technical expertise domain. For example, Like hospital head hospital lead people Doctor hospital worse point person fields lead understand real scenario mechanism hospital functioning understand staff patient well. Hence, lead hospital Doctor deserved field lead understand real scenario it. That’s leader requires technical expertise great knowledge understanding organization. Every person leader technical expertise organization organization run smoothly, run organization technical expertise field. Paragraph 3: So, leader, boss makes life better, they’re “ A good objective leadership poorly better.” Paragraph 1: When talk AI, people perspectives it. There group people, good knowledge real potential AI, solution problems world facing today. There group people threatened thought taking world. Paragraph 2: The field birth Alan Turing 1950 thought “Can machines think?”. Later 1980s, adoption “expert systems” companies world, booming field initiated. Initially, matter awe results achieve. AI’s growth past decades exponential transformed live, work solve challenges. made impact wide variety areas including healthcare, education, business more. But, areas highest impact made recently environment climate change. Paragraph 3: Is Revolutionizing deal Environment Climate Change? Paragraph 4: strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making decarbonising industries building transport, work allocate renewable energy. In recent years, game-changer people, organizations, deal climate change. Microsoft believes artificial intelligence, encompassing machine learning deep learning, “game-changer” climate change environmental issues. The company’s ‘AI Earth’ program committed $50 million years create test applications AI. Paragraph 5: increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid; handle power fluctuations improve energy storage well. Wind companies turbine’s propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating real-time weather operational data. Paragraph 6: improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters Internet Things (the internet computing devices embedded everyday objects, enabling send receive data) forecast energy demand. Besides, artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, flood plains urban planning disaster preparedness. One vision sustainable city create “urban dashboard” consisting real-time data energy water availability, traffic weather make cities energy-efficient livable. Paragraph 7: Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well. Data sensors field monitor crop moisture, soil composition temperature improve production crops watering. Incorporating information drones, monitor conditions, increasingly automatic systems times plant, spray harvest crops, head diseases problems. This result increased efficiency, enhanced yields, lower water, fertilizer pesticides. Paragraph 8: But, good downside? Paragraph 9: When talk effect environment climate, sides coin elucidated. So, positives discussed above, usage downside. Paragraph 10: Last year’s World Economic Forum report showed address Earth’s environmental challenges, important manage properly. According forum experts field, potential accelerate environmental degradation. The power-intensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C02 emissions. Paragraph 11: Although half century, question environmental impact – ethical issues – arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data strong computational power. Paragraph 12: For advances enabled artificial intelligence, speech recognition self-driving cars, systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate-changing carbon emissions. Paragraph 13: A study year found training off-the-shelf language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds emissions – amount produced flying person roundtrip New York San Francisco. But ways make machine learning cleaner greener, movement called “Green AI.” Some algorithms power-hungry others, example, training sessions moved remote locations power renewable sources. Paragraph 14: The key, however, developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reduced. Paragraph 15: What done? Paragraph 16: To prevent this, proposition World Economic Forum report advancements “safe” pursued, ensure humanity developing harmful environment. Specifically, World Economic Forum report developers “must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension.” This means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable, factors. In sense, programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind. Paragraph 17: In future development programs, important note environmental impact creating systems place. According academic study energy usage deep learning processes, creation effective costly environment. Nearly 300,000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model. This basically equal emissions average cars United States. Considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate change crucial, moving forward. Paragraph 18: There room improvement, pioneers machine learning recently published paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed major conference. David Rolnick, postdoctoral fellow University Pennsylvania “call arms” means bring researchers together. Paragraph 19: This paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning used, including energy production, CO2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance more. The main idea build energy-efficient buildings, creating low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources. Artificial intelligence machine learning medium real work caretaker mother earth. Paragraph 20: How forecasting climate change? Paragraph 21: The kick start climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science. It covers wide range topics improving prediction extreme events hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data ice cores, climate up-down scaling impact us. Paragraph 22: “There’s lot uncertainty,” Monteleoni Paragraph 23: Claire Monteleoni, computer science professor University Colorado concludes AI/ ML models generally forecast short-term. There significant difference long-term forecasting. Paragraph 24: The system developed Princeton 1960s. All AI/ ML models developed till revolve atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere ice. achieve heights amount data collected point time, compute complex climate conditions climate modeling algorithms. Paragraph 25: What showing effects extreme weather? Paragraph 26: We climate change real rise atmospheric temperature proof, make realistic, Montreal Institute Learning Algorithms (MILA), Microsoft ConscientAI Labs Generative Adversarial Networks popularly GANs simulate mother earth rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution intensive storms. Paragraph 27: “Our goal convince people climate change real, it’s people real that,” Victor Schmidt, co-author paper Ph.D. candidate Paragraph 28: The project deployed people places future significant climate change. Paragraph 29: Can track carbon emissions? Paragraph 30: Short answer, yes. Tracking carbon emission agendas UN. For year 2020, UN’s goal prevent coal plants built. Satellite images picture deep learning techniques, data science researchers analyze high quality satellite images track emission. Google expanding horizon nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions researchers track pollution. There countries organizations govern CO2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations. Paragraph 31: automate analysis images power plants regular updates emissions. It introduces ways measure plant’s impact, crunching numbers nearby infrastructure electricity use. That’s beneficial gas-powered plants don’t easy-to-measure plumes coal-powered plants have.

Investors naturally fell started buying CDOs. Paragraph 8: So now, risk factor loans transferred Banks Investment Banks CDO Investors. Paragraph 9: With high buying demand CDOs, Investment banks started demanding pressurizing Banks provide Loans provide CDOs Investors. However, Banks provided loans people good credit history regular income people. But hope credit Investment Banks, banks started giving subprime housing loans people low credit scores.Approximately $174Bn worth loans period 2000-2007 clubbed CDOs “AAA” rating Credit Rating Agencies. Approximately 70% CDO’s marked “AAA” rating. Paragraph 10: Investment Banks Credit Rating Agencies enjoying large profits time. Moody’s (a credit rating agency) profits increased 4x times period (2000-2007). Paragraph 11: Looking huge profits made Investment Banks Credit Rating Agencies, Insurance companies (like AIG) started giving insurance CDOs investors called CDS (Credit Default Swap). AIG believed CDOs rated “AAA” (Very Safe Investment), failure chances CDOs minimal. They misjudged unaware fact loans clubbed CDOs Sub Prime loans. Paragraph 12: Now CDO Investors started buying CDS AIG companies safeguard protect losses. AIG started making huge profits premiums investors pay. But realized outcome chance CDOs fail point time. Thus, risk factor transferred CDO investors Insurance Companies. Paragraph 13: Fig – Flow Diagram showing Risk Factors transferred Paragraph 14: Coming loan borrowers now, Sub Prime Borrowers banks unaware fact Adjustable Rate Loans (interest rate loans changing) pay lower interests start interest rates on. Paragraph 15: The borrowers started defaulting loans interest rates increased dramatically 2007 banks resell houses make loans defaulted. Added problem fact borrowers spending amount money pockets taking loans banks providing full amount loans. Almost 50% borrowers pay pocket bought home housing loan. Paragraph 16: This led huge increase defaulters borrowers ultimately banks auction houses gain credit back. With high-interest rates buy auctioned houses, ultimately caused chain reaction banks longer receiving credit. The prices Real Estate started falling drastically people good credit scores earlier housing loans started defaulting price houses/homes fell loan amount earlier. Banks stopped receiving money chain reaction, CDOs ultimately 0. Paragraph 17: Some Investors huge losses Investment companies bankrupt (ex – Lehman Brothers). Moreover, insurance companies pay back investors insurance. As result, insurance companies bankrupt. AIG lost $100Bn paying back investors earlier insured CDOs. However, US Govt. finally decided bail AIG order save bankrupt. Paragraph 18: CDOs CDSs regulated time Federal Reserve situation ultimately led credit crunch (became difficult loans) economy US underwent crisis led global impact world. Unemployment increased manifold businesses shut down. Global trades world crisis finally, Global Recession hit World. Paragraph 1: Gender diversity equal representation genders workplaces.

Paragraph 1: Some vendors (fruit vegetable sellers) began venturing days explicit permission immediately faced police harassment. After weeks, government eased restrictions essential vendors permitted vend (due large part advocacy vendor organizations activist networks). However, cost business, risk, significantly, vendors access wholesale markets suppliers spend travel costs due travel restrictions place city. Also, lockdown partially place, number buyers earnings. Due harsh summer heat, perishable fruits vegetables reduced shelf life vendors unable capitalize produce have. Paragraph 2: The state recently announced stimulus package INR 5000 crore 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging grave impact loss livelihood. The intended relief vendors credit loan provide initial working capital INR 10,000 vendors, sufficient. Instead credit, government converting direct income benefit, cash grant, livelihood support start income activity regularly. The vendors income support restart work, so, return loan. In face ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations step forward advocate vendors provided resources resume livelihoods. To end, vendors organizations advocacy agenda: Paragraph 1: The COVID-19 pandemic grown major socially disruptive health crises recent memory, growing worried pandemic’s catastrophic economic social repercussions affecting food systems global local levels. Given importance retail food environment establishing sustaining healthy diets, interruptions specific aspects it, availability fresh vegetables, negative influence population health, noted source worry.
